AVS-50 Project
==============

This is an old project! I made it 10 years ago.


What is it?
-----------

It’s an audio/video (composite) routing switcher, i used it to switch between video sources on my tv. The tv I had back then only had 1 video input. It consist of a 8×8 video crosspoint (MAX4456) and a 16×16 analog crosspoint (AD8113) controlled by a small microcontroller (PIC18F452). It allowed me to distribute an audio/video signal from 5 different sources to 5 outputs by selecting it on the panel. I could split the audio from one input channel and take the video from another one if I wanted. It has 8 presets I can program to quickly recall channels assignation. It’s still working and I still use it today, but now, it’s used for routing audio only.
